## Contribution

Understanding how cyber attackers operate is an important step towards robust cyber defense techniques. Previous works focused solely on qualitative data while attempting to fill this gap in computer security research. This work seeks to leverage quantitative cyber task data in order to better understand cyber attackers.

In order to conduct their research, the authors focused on the psychological and technological impact of deception techniques to both delay and deter possible attack, regardless of whether the attackers were aware of the defensive countermeasures. The goal is to further use this study to develop state-of-the-art mitigation methods that leverage human decision-making limitations and thus thwart cyber attackers.

The main contribution of this paper is achieved through evaluating the data collected in the Tularosa Study, conducted with expert human subjects, whilst focusing on the efficacy of decoy systems and psychological deception. 

### Strengths

- The study where the data was obtained from, Tularosa, contained huge amounts of data that wasnâ€™t previously analyzed with the same purpose of this work. Obtaining such data would be very difficult due to the setup involved, ranging from participants to network. Leveraging the data for this study was a solid decision.
- Very expansive results, ranging from technical exploits such as the EternalBlue exploit and target selection through Metasploit to altered perception analysis (e.g. psychological deception and decay interactions). The latter are the main focus of this work.


### Weaknesses

- There are various points in the paper where statistical terms are introduced without placing them into the context of the problem. However, there are other points in the paper where it is done, there seems to be no consistency.
- While the study is very extensive, there is very little technological detail to it. Certain exploits are mentioned but there is no explanation regarding the technologies used for deception. It could be interesting to see if state-of-the-art technology was used to further improve defensive countermeasures.


### Points of interest

An interesting result is the fact that decoy techniques seem to be more effective when the attacker is aware of their existence. This claim is supported by the results present in the paper. Furthermore, there is also presented evidence that certain attackers may struggle to deal with decoy countermeasures and proceed with less caution, this approach can further aid faster detection and mitigation. It was also shown that the look for decoys led to significant amounts of wasted resources by the attackers.

The data was collected in a system where an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) was not present in the network. An interesting study would be to perform a similar experiment in which common network defenses are also in place, such as an IDS. It is estimated by experts that about 80% of threats can be stopped through said systems (see link below). In this work, deception is evaluated as a stand alone component nearly (see Q1).


### Questions for discussion

Q1: How would the results change in the presence of a real network, for example with an active IDS, and with real attackers that were further motivated to hide their exploits? Would deception still be as effective?

Q2: Honeypots are a common approach to detect attackers, how do they differ from deception technology? Or would honeypots be classified as deception technology?

Q3: What would be the advantages of using deception technology in the real world? Detecting attackers before a breach, eliminating false positives, scales with network size, orthogonal to network functionality, real time network threat analysis.

This publication is completely out of scope of my research work as I focus on distributed systems and data partitioning.
